# Frontend-Questionnaire-Builder

## Background
During my internship, I built a questionnaire where your unique response for each question leads you to a different follow-up question. Decided to share this questionnaire wrapper for individuals who need a questionnaire beyond the capabilities of basic questionnaire forms.

## Features
### 1. Multiple question types for all question needs:
  - Display (For stating instructions)
  - MCQ: Radio
  - MCQ: Dropdown
  - Short answer
  - Sorting


### 2. Highly customizable experience
  - Configure follow-up questions for certain selected responses
  - Create logical statements to make special question appear for specific selections


### 3. Dashboard that shows historical form submissions
  - Can download to JSON or CSV
  - Can view submitted responses in the form itself

  
### 4. Autosave selection
  - Progress from previous session is saved until submitted

  
### 5. Web and Mobile Responsive
